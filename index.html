                The deJong attractor is a mathematical system that evolves in time, parameterized by
                four parameters \( a, b, c \) and \( d \). The system is determined by the following equations:
                $$
                x_{t+1} = \sin(a y_t) - \cos(b x_t), \\
                y_{t+1} = \sin(c x_t) - \cos(d y_t).
                $$
                The parameters are selected randomly in the interval \( [-3, 3] \).

                then
                attempts
                to move into orbit around the assigned target maintaining this fixed radius. The paths are traced frame
                by frame. About 50% of the time, all objects are assigned the same target.</p>

                is then recursively applied.

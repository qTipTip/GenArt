            <p id="description"> A set of scattered random points are each connected to another point at random. Each
                point then moves
                towards its target at a speed inversely proportional to
                its distance to the target. The lines between each object and its target is traced frame by frame, creating the mesh
                like structure. </p>

                to keep a
                certain
                distance from the other boids. This creates a flocking effect as seen in schools of fish and flocks of birds.</p>

            <p id="description">A set of scattered points are each assigned a target, and a target radius. Each point
                then
                attempts
                to move into orbit around the assigned target maintaining this fixed radius. The paths are traced frame
                by frame. About 50% of the time, all objects are assigned the same target.</p>
